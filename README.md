# Julia Registry for `dannys4`
A Julia registry containing some of my packages, which are by-and-large for uncertainty quantification. This includes packages I want to work together but I don't feel comfortable listing on the `General` registry as they may not be fully cooked yet.

Add via opening julia and typing `] registry add git@github.com:dannys4/dannys4Registry.git`
